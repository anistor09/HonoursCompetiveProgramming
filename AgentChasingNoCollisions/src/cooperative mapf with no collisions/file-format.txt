All vertices are 0-indexed.

.in files have the following format:

[vertex count] [edge count] [agent/target count]
[source_vertex] [target_vertex] [weight/cost/traversal time] # for every edge
[start_vertex] # for every agent
[target_path_length]                      # for every target (length + path)
[target_path_position] [target_path_time] # for every position

.ans files have the following format:

[objective_value] # either the optimal makespan or sum of costs

.sol files have the following format:
[agent] [target] [end_vertex] [end_time] # for every agent-target pair
